<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Make the dough:</p>
<p>1. Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</p>
<p>2. Combine  milk and butter together in a bowl. Microwave or use the stove and heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is warm (110°F/43°C). Whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved. Pour the mixture into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir (use medium speed for stand mixers). Mix until a soft dough forms</p>
<p>3. Transfer dough to a floured surface. Using floured hands, knead the dough (3-5 minutes). If the dough is super soft or sticky, add a little more flour. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover loosely, and let the dough rest for about 10 minutes as you get the filling ingredients ready.</p>
<p>Fill the rolls:</p>
<p>After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14×8-inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and brown sugar. Sprinkle it all over the dough. Roll up the dough to make a 14-inch log. Cut into 10–12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9 or 10-inch round baking pan.</p>
<p>Rise:</p>
<p>Cover the pan (use foil or a kitchen towel). Allow the rolls to rise in a  warm environment for 60–90 minutes or until double in size.</p>
<p>Bake the rolls:</p>
<p>After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 24–27 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack as you make the icing. (You can also make the icing as the rolls bake.)</p>
<p>Make the icing:</p>
<p>In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add the butter and beat until smooth and combined, then beat in the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until combined. Using a knife or icing spatula, spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately. </p>
